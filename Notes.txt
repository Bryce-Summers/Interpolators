I may need to convert all of my doubles to floats for the code to work with processing. This might be a pain.

I need to use standard java library functions to recreate Golan’s interface for specifying function input values.


2/2/2015:

The plan:
I need to get the interface working.

Get 1 function working.
Create a string that represents the source code of the function.
Allow the tool to correctly form and write one function.


Once this works, it is a matter of mechanically getting the rest of the functions to work.

I have gotten the builtin functions and the first batch of functions to compile.

1.5 hours.


Proccessing to Java conversions:

1. All methods in Proccessing are public, whereas they will need to be explicitly labeled in java.

2. The java reflection getMethods() function only finds public methods.

3. Proccessing is mostly float based, whereas Java assumes double types. The character 'f' needs to be appended to all number literals.

Replacement rules for quick translation:

"float function_" --> "public float function_"


I need to check what to do with the arcCircles in certain functions, because they throw an error.

I had to remove some troublesome '-' characters due to a character encoding issue.

Fixed some incompatibilities between java compilation versions, i.e. changed (float) casts to (Float) casts.

Made it so closing the tool does not close processing.

Make sure to put data in the data folder, such as code txt.
