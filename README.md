# Interpolators
A Processing 3 Tool that extends the work of Golan Levin's pattern master project.

Please see: https://github.com/golanlevin/Pattern_Master

Current Status
============

In the User Interface Refinement phase.

Functional Visualization:
----------


Selection of Functions
------------

Done, I might want to implement the drawing of the functions as icons next to their names.

Exportation of function code to Processing 3.
--------------

Mechanics are there. Comment only option works. I have not yet figured out how to programmatically create a new tab in the processing editor.

Current Visual appearance
==================
