Notes
----

Proccessing 3 Sketches will display mysterious errors regarding '(' and ')' if you have neglected to write a setup() or draw() method.

If the Tool seems to be drawing at an offset to the window, try resizing the window and the problem should go away.

Do not switch between java mode and python mode when using this tool and this tool only works in java mode.

Never open more than one instance of the Interpolation Curve Tool.
